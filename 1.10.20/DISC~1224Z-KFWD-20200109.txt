.AVIATION...
/12z TAFs/

Quite a challenging forecast this morning, as all D10 terminals
are MVFR and below 2000 feet currently, but a strong 40 knot+ flow
at 925mb is helping to semi-couple the boundary layer with the
surface. The challenges this presents is occasionally stronger
sustained southerly wind speeds and gusts, along with patchy
sprinkles or drizzle that result in cigs to briefly mix above 2000
feet, or plummet toward 1000 feet or possibly less later this
morning after 15z. I couldn`t rule out an hour or two brief IFR
cigs around 900 feet between 15z-18z if wind speeds were able to
diminish enough and/or if any brief heavier drizzle or sprinkles
were to occur.

I expect cigs to rise up through higher MVFR levels and into the
VFR category between 3500-5000 feet between 20z today and 00z
Friday. Strong warming of the low levels and increasing winds
speeds help to mix the boundary layer during this period and help
cigs lift into VFR. A lead mid level impulse (noted below in the
public discussion) will also be lifting ENE across the area
during peak heating and should trigger scattered -SHRA/isolated
TS from DFW/I-35 corridor and further east where the stronger
warm advection and deeper moisture profiles will reside. I will
only introduce VCSH at this time due to low confidence on TS
development and coverage; especially with all D10 terminals being
on the western fringe of the deeper moisture and ascent.

These trends will need to monitored closely thru the day for any
amendments regarding both cigs and low coverage of convection.
I do believe there will be some impact to departure/arrival rates
on EB traffic, as well as traffic along the Bonham/Cedar Creek
cornerposts. As the LLJ intensifies again after 03z Friday, there
could be a potential for LLWS for a few hours around 06z Friday.

.SHORT TERM... /Issued 421 AM CST Thu Jan 9 2020/
/Today Through Tonight/

Low level warm advection was in full-blown mode early this
morning as expected and denoted by 40-50 knot 925mb flow. Surface
dew point temperatures have quickly recovered into the lower to
mid 50s with a very expansive stratus canopy across the region.
The strong 925mb southerly flow was remaining coupled with the
surface and combining with increasing pressure falls to our west
for gusty south winds 15-20 mph. Gusts were generally in the 25-30
mph category and this should remain the case today as I do not
expect winds to increase into Wind Advisory category values.
Regardless, crosswinds on north to south highways and roads will
cause issues with high-profile vehicles, as well as very choppy
open waters on area lakes. Moisture underneath a slow-rising
capping inversion through the day will be riches along and east of
the I-35 corridor, so I cannot rule out patchy sprinkles or
drizzle in our eastern CWA through midday or early afternoon.

As our main western CONUS mid level system continues moving
slowly eastward today, a couple of lead mid level impulses will
eject northeast from Mexico later this morning and afternoon,
before shunting east-southeast away from North and Central Texas.
With moisture this morning being much more shallow in nature west
of I-35, I do believe partial sunshine will return to these areas
this afternoon, especially along and west of US 281. Deeper low
level moisture further east will be stubborn to mix and break out
of with slightly cooler highs this afternoon. Highs between 70 and
75 degrees along and west of I-35 looks reasonable, with highs
more in the 60s further east.

Though the capping inversion will remain somewhat stout and slow-
rising through much of the day, very steep mid level lapse rates
above the cap will combine with increasing surface dew points in
the lower-mid 60s along and east of I-35 to result in SBCAPE
values 500-1000 J/KG to evolve later this afternoon. Isentropic
ascent associated with the strong and ongoing warm advection will
combine with the increasing moisture and increasing MUCAPE values
for at least low chances for thunderstorms across eastern parts of
the CWA. This trend will continue into the tonight period as
impressive height falls transit eastward from the Desert Southwest
states and Rockies toward the Southern High Plains tonight. How
quickly our capping inversion saturates, lifts, and weakens is
hard to gauge at this point, but it appears both steep mid level
lapse rates and increasing values of both MUCAPE and SBCAPE will
evolve through the night into early Friday morning. Residual
isentropic ascent on the western edge of the broad warm sector
across the region will be enough for at least isolated- scattered
thunderstorms along and east of I-35 and where deeper rich
moisture can overcome any dry air entrainment in the mid levels
from the ever-weakening and ascending capping inversion aloft.
Late this afternoon and tonight, I cannot rule out a strong storm
or two with at least pea-hail and potentially gusty winds in our
far eastern counties if any updrafts can tap into some increasing
SBCAPE increasing across the area.

I expect yet another very breezy and mild night by early January
standards tonight with lows ranging from mid-upper 50s west of US
281, to the lower-mid 60s elsewhere. Yet another expansive stratus
canopy will rapidly expand northward across much of the region
with low level jet winds of 35-45 knots continuing just in advance
of our vigorous approaching system. We should just remain just
below Wind Advisory criteria late this evening and overnight
through daybreak Friday, but it is something that will need to be
re-assessed later today. Still, south winds 15-25 mph with a few
gusts to/or in excess of 30 mph will remain possible across
especially Central Texas and areas along and east of I-35 tonight.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 421 AM CST Thu Jan 9 2020/
/Friday Onward/

A potent weather system will be moving through the region Friday
and Saturday, bringing multiple threats to parts of North and
Central Texas. Severe weather will be possible Friday afternoon,
followed by an increasing potential of winter weather across
portions of North Texas.

Friday and Saturday...

By Friday morning, the upper level trough axis will be moving
into the West Texas, keeping a southerly fetch in place for much
of the region. Rapid moisture transport will allow PWs to climb to
around 1.5  1.6 which is well above average for this time
of the year; in fact, this is about 3 times higher than normal.
The ingredients will likely come together to produce multiple
hazards ranging from large hail, damaging winds, tornadoes,
flooding, and winter winter.

--Severe Weather--

Friday afternoon and evening is now being captured by several of
the higher resolution models, helping to add additional details
and better clarity in the location and timing of convective
development. Through the course of the last 24 hours, models have
shown a slight retardation in the eastward progression of the
surface low expected to form west to east along the Red River
Friday afternoon. This gradual slow down in the low means that
ascent will be farther west during peak heating and the surface
front will also be slightly delayed. The timing is important
because the risk of severe weather has now shifted slightly
westward to include much of population centers in both North and
Central Texas.

The air mass ahead of the approaching cold front will be
characterized by dew points in the mid to upper 60s with a
plentiful supply of moisture streaming along a 60-65 mph low level
jet. During the morning and early afternoon hours, a thermal
inversion centered at around 800 mb will keep deep convection from
developing, but as the main upper level trough advances eastward,
dynamic cooling will help erode and lift the cap. As it does so,
convective inhibition will cease and instability will
significantly increase along and east of I-35. With cooling
temperatures aloft, lapse rates are likely range between 7.5-8
C/km, enhancing the large hail threat mainly east of I-35.

If an updraft is able to develop in the warm sector, it would
likely become supercellular given the strong effective bulk shear
and high instability. Hazards from any supercell will include
damaging winds, large hail as well as tornadoes. This threat will
be highly dependent on whether or not a storm will manage to
develop out ahead of the cold front.

The second area to watch will be the line of thunderstorms
expected to develop along the I-35 corridor. An eastward moving
cold front will further electrify the atmosphere east of I-35 as
strong surface convergence and ample amounts of moisture leads to
a QLCS scenario. Strong unidirectional southwest to northeast wind
profiles suggest damaging winds will be the primary threat with
the eastward moving line. Bow echoes with embedded tornadic
circulations could develop anywhere along the line. Although the
hail threat is expected to diminish with the line of
thunderstorms, cant rule out an overzealous storm capable of
producing hail.

--Flooding Potential---

The flash flooding potential has increased since the last
forecast package given model consensus is beginning to take shape.
Strong upper level divergence will enhance large scale forcing
for ascent, which is mentioned in the section above. Increased
instability and well above average precipitable water values will
make any shower or thunderstorm capable of producing heavy
rainfall. Another factor to consider is that vegetation across
the region is now dormant, meaning infiltration will be at a
minimum and most of the rain is likely to run off. Given those
conditions, combined with the rainfall expected today and tonight,
a Flash Flood Watch has been issued starting at noon Friday and
continuing into late Friday night. Widespread 2-3 inches with
isolated higher amounts can be expected in areas that are both
north of I-30 and east of I-35.

--Winter Weather--

As the low level circulation moves across the Red River, strong
vertical ascent associated with vigorous frontogenetical forcing
appears likely across portions of North Texas. The big question at
play continues to be whether or not there will be enough moisture
to allow dendrites to form and fall to the surface. Latest
guidance has come in with increased confidence that a wintry mix
will be possible for areas that are north of a line from Graham to
Fort Worth to Paris. At this time, no accumulations are expected
anywhere south of US-380. Areas that are north of US-380, a
dusting of snow could be possible as precipitation is coming to an
end, especially to grassy and elevated surfaces. Deepening cold
air aloft would likely change over any lingering light cold rain
to light snow. Something that will need to be carefully monitored
in subsequent forecasts will be the mid and upper level lapse
rates in conjunction with the vertical shear profile. If
conditions are just right, cant rule out a possible burst of
snow causing additional minimal accumulations, especially on
grassy areas north of US-380.

Any wintry precipitation will come to an end by late Saturday
morning as the main forcing for ascent exits to the northeast.
Highs Saturday will likely range from the upper 30s across the Red
River to the mid 50s in Central Texas.

Sunday Onward...

A brief brake from the precipitation will commence on Sunday as
subsident air remains locked across North and Central Texas. The
sub-tropical branch of the jet stream will remain oriented from
west to east along I-20 through the middle of the week, with
moisture slowly returning to the region Monday afternoon. Showers
and thunderstorm will be possible mainly across East Texas through
the remainder of the week. There are still significant
differences in a possible cold front arriving mid to late next
week. Given those differences, have gone with low rain chances and
normal to slightly below normal temperatures.
