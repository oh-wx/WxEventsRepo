.SHORT TERM...
/This Afternoon through Saturday/

A surface low is currently situated over South Texas with a warm
front extending northeast across Southeast Texas, and a weak
surface trough extending northward along I-35. The Metroplex is
currently split between northwest winds and temperatures in the
40s on the west side of the trough, and southeast winds/lower 50s
temps on the east side. On either side, as is the case across most
of the region, fog and occasional drizzle continues to linger and
may end up hanging around through the afternoon and into the
evening. Fortunately, there is no dense fog as visibilities have
remained a mile or more. There will be a broad range in high
temperatures, with the western-most counties likely topping out in
the 40s, areas east of the I-35 corridor in the 55 to 60 degree
range, and the southern-most counties (who will end up south of
the warm front) near 70.

Showers will be on the increase later this afternoon as a
shortwave disturbance lifts northeast across the region.
Precipitation associated with this feature is already increasing
over South Central/Southwest Texas. Visibilities will likely
improve as the showers move in and mixes out the fog.
Thunderstorms will be possible, but should remain fairly isolated
due to limited instability.

The shortwave will exit to the northeast as a cold front moves in
from the northwest tonight. Convergence along the front should be
sufficient for additional showers overnight, mainly east of I-35
where the better moisture will linger. The front should reach the
I-20 corridor just before daybreak Saturday, then push through
the remainder of the area Saturday morning. Cooler and drier air
behind the front will keep temperatures in the 40s and 50s for
Saturday.

.AVIATION...
/18Z TAFs/

A weak trough extending from near KAUS to DFW is the source of
the varying winds in the Metroplex and Central Texas. DFW has
shifted to a light west wind, but will likely shift to the south
again later this afternoon. Either way, wind speeds should remain
at or below 10 kt for the next few hours, before return flow
takes over and brings southeast winds up into the 10-15kt range
later this afternoon.

LIFR cigs should persist until showers move in from the
southwest, "improving" conditions to IFR after 21Z. Isolated
thunder will be possible after 21Z, but at this time it looks like
it will remain too isolated to include in any of the TAFs.
Showers will exit to the northeast this evening. A cold front
will bring northwest winds in the DFW Metroplex by 12Z Saturday,
which is around the time conditions will finally improve to VFR.
FROPA & VFR will arrive at KACT around 15Z Saturday.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 328 AM CST Fri Jan 17 2020/

/Sunday through Next Friday/

After a brief reprieve from the rain from the latter half of the
weekend through Tuesday, a slightly wetter pattern is expected to
unfold around mid-week into next weekend. Daytime high
temperatures through mid-week next week will be below normal with
a slight warming trend thereafter. Morning conditions will feel
chilly before moderating through the end of the long term period.

A ridge of high pressure should settle in across the Southern
Plains on Sunday and will linger through the day on Monday. Light
winds, clear skies, and the dry airmass will promote optimal
radiational cooling and a freeze is anticipated for most locales
(outside of the immediate D/FW Metroplex and parts of Central
Texas) for the first few mornings of the long term forecast
period. As mid-level ridging breaks down, we`ll see an increase
in high clouds as early as late Monday in through the day Tuesday.
An upper trough swinging through the Midwest will send a diffuse
backdoor frontal boundary through the Ozarks and Northeast Texas.
For this reason, areas north and northeast of the D/FW Metroplex
will likely see Tuesday high temperatures remain in the 40s, while
most other areas climb into the 50s. Rain chances associated with
the backdoor front are low and the better risk for measurable
precipitation will be across the Big Country where a strengthening
WAA regime will be in place late Tuesday into early Wednesday.

Ascent thanks to the warm air advection (WAA) regime will be
augmented by lift from a broad, but quick moving upper trough,
forecast to traverse the Southern Plains during the pre-dawn hours
on Wednesday. With the cooler air in the mid-levels associated
with this diffuse upper trough, there may be a low-end potential
for a few sleet pellets to mix in with the light rain, mainly
along the Red River. In fact, forecast soundings do suggest that
if enough evaporative cooling can occur, a very wet snow/sleet mix
may not be out of the realm of possibility (though amounts will be
light and this should mitigate impacts). For now, I`ll leave
winter wx out of the forecast and reassess this over the next few
days. Deterministic model guidance is quite bullish with PoPs late
Tuesday into Wednesday and given the very modest nature of the
trough and WAA, I feel the lower PoPs advertised by some of the
blends are more appropriate.

The best rain chances will slowly shift eastward ahead of the
next main upper trough forecast to arrive from the west. The 00
UTC deterministic ECMWF remains among the slower guidance with the
southern stream trough with a host of other medium/long range
guidance offering a more progressive scenario. Given that this
feature will likely undergo some amplification, it should slow and
this is inferred from a dprog/dt of the last few ECMWF runs. I`ll
delay the onset of the greater PoPs by just a hair on late
Thursday and will indicate a slower clearing trend on Friday.
Enough instability may exist for a few isolated storms. Severe
weather is not expected at this time. Rain/storm chances should
come to an end sometime Friday evening/early next Saturday.
