.SHORT TERM... /Issued 105 AM CST Thu Jan 30 2020/
/Through Tonight/

The next upper level shortwave is now making its way across the
Desert Southwest and is moving east toward the region. In the
meantime, low level moisture has led to the expansion of a shroud
of clouds that now covers much of the Plains and into the Midwest.
With much of the moisture remaining in place as the next system
inches closer to the region, expect yet another day of cloudy
skies across the region.

Isentropic ascent is expected to increase through much of the
morning, and by this afternoon, an area of precipitation is
expected to initially develop south of our area. The area of
precipitation will likely expand as it travels northeastward,
affecting areas mainly along and east of I-35.

The main challenge over the next 24 hours will be the
precipitation type expected to reach the ground. The thermodynamic
assessment implies that there will be a layer of dry air between
600-800mb. Above that, strong isentropic ascent in a mostly
saturated layer would suggest precipitation will most likely be
falling. As precipitation falls into the dry layer, cooling
effects will decrease the freezing layer to around 5,000 ft AGL.
With enough ascent and steep lapse rates, convective elements may
lead to a few sleet pellets falling from the most intense
updrafts. Given surface temperatures are expected to remain in the
40s while any frozen precipitation falls, no impacts are
expected.

All precipitation will gradually move east and northeast through
the evening and overnight hours, leading to another chilly night
across the region. Low temperatures tonight will likely range from
the lower 30s in the west to lower 40s in the east.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 251 AM CST Thu Jan 30 2020/
/Friday through Wednesday/

Moisture will wrap around a departing low pressure system Friday
keeping clouds in place for much of the morning.  The moisture
will be shallow and measurable precipitation is not expected,
however, a few sprinkles can`t be ruled out. Dry air will filter
in from the northwest in the afternoon resulting in decreasing
clouds. Afternoon highs will be near seasonal normals, ranging
from the lower to middle 50s. A mostly clear sky, dry air and
light wind will result in rapid radiational cooling after sunset,
with lows falling into the 30s.

A warming trend will begin in earnest Saturday with a high amplitude
ridge building in from the west. Abundant sun will allow for mild
afternoon temperatures mainly in the 60s. Temperatures will
increase even more on Sunday as the upper ridge builds overhead
and southerly winds and low level moisture both increase. Highs
Sunday will range from the upper 60s in the northeast to the
middle 70s across the west.

The upper ridge axis will slide to the east Sunday night in response
to a developing trough across the western states. Increasing low
level warm/moist advection will result in increasing clouds and
a mild night with lows from the mid 40s to the lower 50s.
Monday will also be mostly cloudy and mild with highs from the mid
60s to the mid 70s. Some warm air advection showers will also be
possible, mainly across the eastern half of the region where
moisture will be most abundant. A few showers will likely linger
in the east through Monday night.

Another cold front is progged to move across the region Tuesday,
resulting in falling temperatures and a breezy northerly wind.  Lift
along the front, coupled with broad large scale lift associated
with and approaching upper trough, may be sufficient for some
additional showers/isolated thunderstorms in the east.  Since
moisture will be limited, we will keep PoPs low for now.

The forecast will get a bit more complicated as we head into Tuesday
night and Wednesday since cold air will be in place in the low
levels of the atmosphere and both the GFS and ECMWF move the
upper tough east across the state. The big uncertainty will be
just how much moisture will be available. Since confidence is so
low this far out, have decided to not bite off on mentioning any
type of winter precipitation. Therefore we will keep precipitation
all liquid for now and PoPs low.

.AVIATION... /NEW/
/12Z TAF/

A thick veil of MVFR continues to be in place across North and
Central Texas in anticipation of the next upper level shortwave.
This shortwave is currently west of our region, poised to make the
trip eastward across North and Central Texas later this afternoon.
As it does so, rain chances will increase as large scale forcing
for ascent increases. Given the cold temperatures aloft, there may
be a brief period where sleet pellets mix in with the rain. Given
temperatures will remain in the 40s throughout the precipitation
event, no impacts are expected at this time.

The northeasterly winds in place will gradually become
northwesterly, generally between 15-20 knots. As the
precipitation moves eastward, a gradual improvement in CIGs is
expected. Have sided with a slightly more optimistic forecast
regarding the return of VFR skies around midnight tonight.
